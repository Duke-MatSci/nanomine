## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
# NOTE: some work needs to be done to fully support
#       running in dev mode now that the build target 
#       is Whyis. Basic GUI work can probably be tested, but
#       that's about it.
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
